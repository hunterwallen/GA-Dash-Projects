      <p>It is impossible to tell my whole story in a single sitting. We all have so many tiny pieces that make up the whole of who we are. But knowing a little more about who I am today can put some of my experiences and opinions into perspective. So here goes nothing...</p>
     <h3><a href=https://theoutspokenoutcast.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/opinions-borne-out-of-empathy/>Opinions Borne Out Of Empathy</a></h3>
     <p>How many transgender people do you know? How many recovering addicts do you know? How many convicted felons do you know? Now I'm not asking how many you have met.

In my experience, the vast majority of people say one thing and then do the exact opposite...</p>

     <p>My story thus far isnt always pretty. I've said and done plenty of things I am not proud of. And I am not alone. We all have skeletons in our closet and demons in our mind. But if there is one thing I know in this life it is this...</p>
